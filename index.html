									<p>I was always not quite sure about moving to San Francisco. I've heard about this place for my entire life: back in high school, during the first bubble, I would read Slashdot and wonder about life out west. But San Francisco is like a vortex for software developers. It's got this gravitational pull that's hard to escape. When I made the choice to move here, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to handle it. Turns out I can't.</p>

									<p>So I'm leaving. My job is great, but it's not worth staying in this city. I haven't done anything outside of work in a few months. I go to work, work hard, go home, and then go to sleep. I don't go home late. I go home at five. It's not work/life balance that's the issue. I'm just not psyched for the 'life' part. San Francisco has sucked out all my creativity, most of my passion, and has made me increasingly frustrated with things. Elaborating further would just be repeating Tom Dale and tef with not much difference, so I'll leave it at that.</p>

									<p>So, at the end of the month, I'm leaving Balanced and the city. I'll be arriving in Brooklyn, a place I've been trying to live for the past few years. I'm going to deeply miss my friends and my (ex-)coworkers, but I have a lot of friends in NYC, too. Every hour I spend in New York, I feel excited, and every hour I spend in San Francisco, I feel drained.</p>

									<p>So here's to new adventures. I can't wait to be happy again.</p>

							Moving On from a Life's Work
									ETHAN KAPLAN

									<p>When I was 16 years old I started a website.</p>

									<p>That is the beginning of my history when I am introduced by someone or introduce myself.</p>

									<p>When I was 16 years old, I started a website.</p>

									<p>When I was 35 years old, I shut that web site down. That was last night.</p>

									<p>Turning back the clock then.</p>

									<p>On March 23, 1996 I was seated about midway back at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles, CA. This was when the Wiltern still had seats. I was there to see Patti Smith's first show in Los Angeles in 15 years.</p>

									<p>I was also a huge R.E.M. fan, having seen them the prior October in Anaheim. In fact I was wearing a tour t-shirt 'just in case' any of them happened to be in attendance.</p>

									<p>Right before the show started, a bald guy sat in front of me. I turned to my date that night with a look of "No, it can’t be."</p>

									<p>After he got up to go get a drink, I asked the guy sitting next to him (later revealed to be Lance Bangs) who that was, and if it was Michael Stipe. He first said no, then seeing my face said "yes, it is, just don’t bother him."</p>

									<p>I didn't. Until after the show.</p>

									<p>For the entire show I watched as he sang along, cried, screamed, yelled and chatted with his friends, including Mike Mills.</p>

									<p>After the show ended I nervously tapped him on the shoulder, stammered something about being a huge fan and held out my ticket envelope. He grabbed it, signed it and said, "I don’t usually sign things, so don’t tell anyone."</p>

									<p>I promised not to.</p>

									<p>I didn't keep the promise.</p>

									<p>At this point I was also working as the webmaster at the Orange County Register, so heavily into learning all things about the web, including Perl, HTML, etc. After the show, I scanned the signed ticket envelope and started hacking together a website that paid tribute to my (then) two big interests: R.E.M. and Patti Smith.</p>

									<p>I did the site in Frontpage, and used their server side extensions to get a Guestbook, discussion board and some rudimentary CMS functions. I found a host in Florida called H-Way (one of the Microsoft certified hosting companies), got my dads credit card and set an account up.</p>

									<p>Four weeks or so later the site was ready to go and I had to choose a domain name. Since it was an R.E.M. site I decided to use album names.

									<p>chronictown.com was taken by the band. murmur.com by a heart foundation non-profit. Reckoning.com was as well. Fables.com seemed lame, so Murmurs.com it was. On April 26, 1996 I registered the domain name and adjusted DNS and the site was born.</p>

									<p>I announced it on Usenet.</p>

									<p>The next 18 years were too hard to describe.</p>

									<p>Murmurs.com became a community in a very rich sense. At any point, hundreds of people were on in tucked away corners of the site. Cultures emerged, language specific areas (especially from Europe) thrived. People met, fell in love, met each other, got married and had kids.</p>

									<p>I am naturally shy, and still ended up meeting hundreds of Murmursians (as we were called) in person at various R.E.M. shows. I met my wife through a member of the site. She met her husband through the same means.</p>

									<p>The band eventually became wise to it, and we did interviews, chats, meet and greets and contests. They lurked occasionally. The office staff and I became great friends.</p>

									<p>Through this, I became friends with the band, got a job at their record label. They even recorded a song for my first dance at my wedding.</p>

									<p>At it's peak, Murmurs.com was ten thousand active users with about 3,000 active posters. There would be upwards of 5,000 posts on any given day, and a few hundred people on at any given time. The chat room became bustling on Sundays, and when we added the Torrent tracker to the mix, the trading community had their own little enclave as well.</p>

									<p>It wasn't always great. I'm shy by nature, and people can be mean behind text on a screen. I had people attack me, set up parody sites (including the great ihateethankaplan.com out of Norway), stalk me at R.E.M. events and threaten my physically.</p>

									<p>I took a lot of what happened on Murmurs way too personally, and likely invested way too much of myself in its health and well being, at the expense of my own.</p>

									<p>On an academic level, I look at the 18 years of Murmurs.com as a great example of an emergent community around fanaticism. The careful balancing of celebrating a cultural artifact (in this case, a band), and proclaiming ownership of it. Books have been written on this, including Henry Jenkins great Textual Poachers and I even did my masters thesis about this.</p>

									<p>But treating this academically I think does a disservice to the power of what a community can truly hold.</p>

									<p>Some can say Murmurs was killed by Facebook, in that localized "discussion boards" as a nexus for communities have run their course. Some could say the band breaking up had the majority to do with it, or me working with/for the band, or me having children.</p>

									<p>All are true in a way. It was hard for me to post rumors and news when I talk to band members a lot and worked with them as colleagues rather than as a fan. It was also hard to muster the enthusiasm for "what’s next" when I know that "what’s next" is maybe going to dinner with Michael in New York, rather than new music.</p>

									<p>But Murmurs didn't die, it just dissolved. News comes from so many places, and communities are made ad hoc as new mechanisms spring up. Secret, Facebook, Twitter. The little corner of the Internet that loved R.E.M. spread as people grew. I've gotten comments from people at SiriusXM, blogs, Twitter and e-mail. People who were on Murmurs went on to do great things and still today I run into new people who knew me first from "that R.E.M. site."</p>

									<p>I will grow old being that kid from that R.E.M. site.</p>

									<p>I don't mind.</p>

									<p>I've come close to shutting Murmurs down many times, so why now? I don't know. It was time. It wasn't thought out, it was just something I did at 6:30PM on a random work day because I didn't feel like debugging Wordpress’s upgrade error.</p>

									<p>But after I put up the "farewell" page (ironically on a service that specializes in startup pre-launch splash pages), I felt a sense of relief.</p>

									<p>One thing that fascinates me about the Internet is that it is without memory so long as the bits don't rot. With Murmurs, the bits were rotting slightly, but if you look hard enough, the evidence of the "me" that was once 19, 20, 21, etc still lingers, all associated with this one website for this one band.</p>

									<p>I remember the night I started Murmurs, and so many things that happened since. But memory is only given power to be a memory if it is given the finality of an ending.</p>

									<p>My life with this website has ended.</p>

									<p>My life with the band, and it's fans never will.</p>
